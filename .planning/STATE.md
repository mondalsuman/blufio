# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** An always-on personal AI agent that is secure enough to trust, efficient enough to afford, and simple enough to deploy by copying one file.
**Current focus:** v1.5 PRD Gap Closure -- Phase 53 Data Classification & PII Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 53 of 63 (Data Classification & PII Foundation) -- first of 11 phases in v1.5
Plan: 4 of 5 in Phase 53
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Phase 53 Plan 04 completed (17min)

Progress: [###---------------------------] 9%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0-v1.4):**
- Total plans completed: 151
- Total execution time: ~11 days
- Average: ~14 plans/day

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Plans | Days | Avg/Day |
|-----------|-------|------|---------|
| v1.0 | 43 | 3 | ~14 |
| v1.1 | 32 | 2 | ~16 |
| v1.2 | 13 | 1 | ~13 |
| v1.3 | 47 | 4 | ~12 |
| v1.4 | 16 | 1 | ~16 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent: v1.5 roadmap derives 11 phases from 93 requirements across 17 categories at fine granularity.
- Phase 53 Plan 01: PII patterns in single source-of-truth array preventing RegexSet index mismatch
- Phase 53 Plan 01: Overlapping PII match deduplication (longest match wins)
- Phase 53 Plan 01: DataClassification uses derive(Default) with #[default] per clippy
- Phase 53 Plan 02: ClassificationEvent uses String fields to avoid blufio-bus -> blufio-core dependency
- Phase 53 Plan 02: PII redaction runs before secret redaction in combined pipeline
- Phase 53 Plan 02: Restricted data excluded from memory retrieval via SQL WHERE clause
- Phase 53 Plan 03: API routes use {param} syntax (axum v0.8+) for route path parameters
- Phase 53 Plan 03: PII detection in agent uses catch_unwind for panic safety
- Phase 53 Plan 03: Context filtering uses defense-in-depth (SQL primary + guard reference)
- Phase 53 Plan 04: Default::default() for classification field in struct literals across workspace
- Phase 53 Plan 04: row_to_message/row_to_session helpers with unwrap_or_default for resilient parsing
- Phase 53 Plan 04: Closure-based condition builder in bulk_update to avoid dry_run/execute duplication

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Claude tokenizer accuracy: Xenova/claude-tokenizer is community artifact (~80-95% accuracy for Claude 3+)
- tiktoken-rs binary size: Embeds BPE vocabulary data. Measure impact against <50MB binary constraint
- v1.5 scope is largest milestone yet (93 requirements). Monitor velocity against prior milestones
- Litestream + SQLCipher incompatibility: Must document and provide application-level backup alternative
- Hot reload complexity: Research recommends careful phasing. ArcSwap swap is atomic but downstream propagation is not
