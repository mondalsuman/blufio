# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-03-01T22:00:00Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 37/70 requirements satisfied | 5/10 phases verified

---

## Executive Summary

Milestone v1.0 has **37 of 70 requirements formally satisfied** (verified by VERIFICATION.md), **12 partial** (claimed by SUMMARY but unverified), and **21 unsatisfied** (no verification, no SUMMARY claim). The integration checker confirmed that most unverified code IS wired and functional, but 5 phases (02, 05, 06, 08, 09) lack VERIFICATION.md files entirely. Three critical cross-phase integration breaks were found.

The primary gap is **documentation/verification**, not implementation. Most code exists and is wired. However, 3 integration issues are genuine code bugs that need fixing.

## Phase Verification Status

| Phase | Verified? | Status | Requirements | Score |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 01: Project Foundation & Workspace | Yes | passed | 7/7 (CORE-06 partial) | 8/8 |

| 03: Agent Loop & Telegram | Yes | human_needed | 12/12 | 5/5 |
| 04: Context Engine & Cost Tracking | Yes | passed | 9/9 | 13/13 |
| 05: Memory & Embeddings | **No** | UNVERIFIED | 0/4 verified (code wired per integration check) | — |
| 06: Model Routing & Smart Heartbeats | **No** | UNVERIFIED | 0/2 verified (code wired, 1 integration bug) | — |
| 07: WASM Skill Sandbox | Yes | passed | 8/8 | 20/20 |
| 08: Plugin System & Gateway | **No** | UNVERIFIED | 0/5 verified (code wired per integration check) | — |
| 09: Production Hardening | **No** | UNVERIFIED | 0/10 verified (code wired, 1 integration bug) | — |
| 10: Multi-Agent & Final Integration | Yes | passed | 2/2 | SC-1 + SC-2 |

## Critical Integration Issues

### P0: Tool Content Block Serialization Break

**Severity:** CRITICAL — breaks all multi-turn tool conversations
**Location:** `crates/blufio-agent/src/lib.rs:399-415`, `crates/blufio-anthropic/src/lib.rs:411-437`
**Affects:** SKILL-01 through SKILL-06, INFRA-06

Tool follow-up messages construct `ContentBlock::Text{json_string}` where Anthropic API expects structured `ToolUse`/`ToolResult` blocks. The types `ApiContentBlock::ToolUse` and `ApiContentBlock::ToolResult` exist in `types.rs` but `convert_content_blocks()` never produces them. Result: 400 API error on any multi-turn tool conversation. The E2E test suite does not exercise this path.

### P1: Vault Startup Check Never Called

**Severity:** HIGH — breaks vault-backed API key retrieval
**Location:** `crates/blufio-vault/src/lib.rs:17` → `crates/blufio/src/serve.rs` (missing call)
**Affects:** SEC-03

`vault_startup_check()` is exported but never imported or called in serve.rs. Users who run `blufio config set-secret` to store API keys in the vault will find `blufio serve` fails because the key is no longer in config or env.

### P2: KeypairAuthAdapter Not Wired to Gateway

**Severity:** HIGH — gateway accepts unauthenticated requests when bearer_token=None
**Location:** `crates/blufio/src/serve.rs:238-254`, `crates/blufio-gateway/src/auth.rs`
**Affects:** SEC-02

The `keypair` feature gate and log message say "keypair auth will be used" but `KeypairAuthAdapter` is never instantiated or passed to the gateway auth middleware. When `bearer_token=None`, all gateway requests pass through unauthenticated.

### P3: Tool Follow-Up Bypasses Model Router

**Severity:** MEDIUM — incorrect model used for tool continuation calls
**Location:** `crates/blufio-agent/src/lib.rs:432`
**Affects:** LLM-05

Tool follow-up requests use `self.config.anthropic.default_model` instead of the model selected by the router for the initial request. Cost is attributed to the wrong model.

## Broken E2E Flows

| # | Flow | Break Point | Affected |
|---|------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Multi-turn tool_use conversation | ContentBlock serialization in tool follow-up messages | SKILL-01 through SKILL-06 |
| 2 | Vault-backed API key → serve | vault_startup_check() never called at serve time | SEC-03 |

### Working E2E Flows

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Basic message pipeline (Telegram → Agent → Anthropic → response) | Complete |
| 2 | Memory extraction (idle → MemoryStore → MemoryProvider → context) | Complete |
| 3 | Multi-agent delegation (DelegationRouter → specialist → signed response) | Complete |

## Missing Documentation

### Missing VERIFICATION.md Files (5 phases)

| Phase | SUMMARY Claims | Integration Wired? |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 02: Persistence & Security Vault | 11 requirements claimed | Yes (all wired) |
| 05: Memory & Embeddings | 0 claimed (SUMMARYs missing/empty) | Yes (all wired) |
| 06: Model Routing & Smart Heartbeats | N/A (no SUMMARY files) | Yes (1 bug found) |
| 08: Plugin System & Gateway | 0 claimed (SUMMARYs empty) | Yes (all wired) |
| 09: Production Hardening | 0 claimed (SUMMARYs empty) | Yes (1 bug found) |

### Missing SUMMARY.md Files

| Phase | Missing SUMMARYs |
|-------|-----------------|
| 05 | 05-01-SUMMARY.md, 05-02-SUMMARY.md |
| 06 | 06-01-SUMMARY.md, 06-02-SUMMARY.md, 06-03-SUMMARY.md |

### ROADMAP.md Sync Issues

- Phase 7 checkbox still `[ ]` despite VERIFICATION passing
- Plan 03-04 checkbox still `[ ]` despite SUMMARY existing
- Plan 07-04 checkbox still `[ ]` despite SUMMARY existing
- Progress table shows Phase 7 as "Gap closure planned" despite gap being closed

### REQUIREMENTS.md Sync Issues

33 requirements in traceability table marked "Pending" that are actually satisfied per VERIFICATION.md evidence.

## Tech Debt by Phase

| Phase | Items |
|-------|-------|
| 01 | CORE-06 partial (jemalloc only; bounded caches/channels deferred) |
| 03 | 3 human verification items pending (live Telegram, session persistence, SIGTERM drain) |
| 04 | `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` in session.rs; 3 human verification items |
| 05 | Missing 2 SUMMARY files, missing VERIFICATION |
| 06 | Missing ALL 3 SUMMARY files, missing VERIFICATION |
| 07 | ROADMAP not updated post-gap-closure |
| 08 | 3 SUMMARYs have empty requirements_completed, missing VERIFICATION |
| 09 | 3 SUMMARYs have empty requirements_completed, missing VERIFICATION |
| 10 | E2E tests don't cover tool_use path (broken serialization undetected) |
| Meta | ROADMAP.md + REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table out of sync |
