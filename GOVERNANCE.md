# Governance

## Decision-Making

Blufio uses a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life) governance model. The project
maintainer has final decision authority on all matters including architecture,
features, and releases.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome via pull requests. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
for requirements.

## Architectural Decisions

Significant architectural decisions are documented in the `.planning/` directory.

## RFC Process

For significant changes:

1. Open a GitHub issue describing the proposed change
2. Label it with `rfc`
3. Allow time for community discussion
4. The maintainer makes the final decision

Minor changes and bug fixes do not require an RFC.
